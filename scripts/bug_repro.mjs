// What a reproducer is, and where it lives, is the preamble of BUGS-TO-REPORT.md
// ("Reproducer projects"). A reproducer is bugs/<slug>/ while its entry is queued
// and bugs/filed/<slug>/ once the entry has been filed upstream: a filed bug is not
// a fixed one, and its reproducer is what says when it is. This tool keeps the
// three files in step -- the source
// tree, the packed .twinproj and the zip for the GitHub issue -- and puts a
// reproducer in front of the compiler, through scripts/tbbuild.mjs and
// scripts/tbrun.mjs, so that an entry can say what it saw and a later beta can be
// asked whether it still does.
//
// bugs/<slug>/repro.json says how to ask. `verify` reads it for every reproducer:
// the mode (compile, build, run, cli, lane, probe or manual), the target, and what
// a reproduction looks like (`expect`). Its keys are listed by loadRepro() below,
// and the contributor-facing description is docs/Documentation/Tools.md. A lane
// reproducer names a lane of test/ide or test/addin and the tests in it that pass
// while the bug is there; a probe reproducer names a script under scripts/ that
// verify runs and judges by `expect`. Only a manual one needs a person.
//
// Exit codes: 0 done, 1 a finding, 2 the tool could not do its job, 3 and up its
// own -- see USAGE. tbbuild's and tbrun's exit codes are mapped into that table by
// TBBUILD_EXIT and TBRUN_EXIT, and are what `expect.exit` in repro.json is
// compared with, unmapped.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------- why this
//
// An entry in BUGS-TO-REPORT.md owes a reader a project that shows the bug. By
// hand, that is an impexp import and a zip, and then a build to see that the bug
// is still there; this does the first two the same way every time and the third
// without a person at the IDE. `verify` is the reason the file exists: an entry
// that no longer reproduces on the newest beta is one to retire or to re-check.
//
// `verify` is never run by a wrapper, a gate or CI. It needs a twinBASIC install,
// and Windows with a private desktop, as examples.bat does. For a filed bug,
// `NO LONGER REPRODUCES` is the signal that a fix has been released.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------- what it relies on
//
//  1. THE ZIP IS WRITTEN IN NODE (scripts/lib/zip.mjs). Compress-Archive is
//     PowerShell and 7-Zip is not on PATH; Git Bash's `tar -a` writes a tar
//     archive under the .zip name and exits 0. Each entry's time is its file's
//     own, so packing an unchanged source tree twice writes the same zip. A
//     reproducer that has a VB6 project beside the twinBASIC one, in
//     bugs/<slug>/vb6/, gets a second zip, <slug>-vb6.zip, of that folder's
//     sources, written the same way; `vb6` builds the project in a temp copy
//     (scripts/lib/vb6.mjs, runRepro), runs its exe on a private desktop, as
//     tbrun --exe does, and prints the out.txt it writes. VB6.EXE
//     is only ever started from there, with an argument array and no shell.
//     A graphical defect carries pictures: repro.json's `images` names them, the
//     PngDump modules (test/repro-templates/png/) save each as <name>.png in the
//     folder BUGREPRO_IMAGES names, `run` and `vb6` keep them in
//     bugs/<slug>/images/ as <name>-tb.png and <name>-vb6.png, and
//     <name>-compare.png (lib/repro-images.mjs, lib/png.mjs) shows both and their
//     difference. `verify` can judge by them (expect.imagesDiffer), and stages its
//     pictures in the temp folder, so it never changes the tree.
//  2. THE PACK IS impexp RUN IN PROCESS (packTree, scripts/lib/tb-project.mjs).
//     It throws where the command line would have refused, and returns the
//     counts the command line prints, which `pack` prints as it does.
//  3. AN IDE THAT RUNS MANY REPRODUCERS OWNS THE REGISTRY TIDY ONCE. Under
//     `verify` this process calls startTidy for every lane, so the tbbuild and
//     tbrun children (which find TB_REGISTRY_OWNER set) leave the registry alone,
//     and nothing a lane that finishes first puts back is another's entry. The
//     lanes use ports base, base+1, ..., which key the work folders tbbuild and
//     tbrun use, as in check_examples.
//  4. `run` STAGES A COPY, never the tree: it adds Sources/TbRunProbe.twin, a
//     module whose [RunAfterBuild] Sub clears the console and calls Main. With
//     --exe that module is left out, because tbrun runs Sub Main in the built exe
//     itself.
//  5. `cli` MODE RUNS THE COMPILER EXECUTABLE (bin\twinBASIC_win32.exe) with
//     stdin from the null device and a time limit, on the packed project, and
//     compares its exit code and output. Paths are given backslashed and in full:
//     `export` prefixes \\?\ to its project path, and cannot find a folder named
//     with forward slashes (WIP.Harness.md, "Getting at the `.twin` sources").
//  6. EACH `cli` COMMAND RUNS ON A PRIVATE DESKTOP, in a kill-on-close job, as
//     the IDE does (scripts/lib/tb-launch.ps1), with its output in files. The
//     compiler opens a modal message box for a damaged project and waits on it
//     for ever; on the user's desktop that box is theirs to close, and on a
//     private one nobody could. The launcher reads each box (title, text) and
//     presses OK, and the output the reproducer's `expect` is matched against
//     starts with one `dialog: <title>: <text>` line per box. `attach` files
//     are copied into the command's temp folder, so {tmp}/<attach path> is a
//     copy a command may damage further.

const USAGE = `usage: node scripts/bug_repro.mjs <command> [slug ...] [--ide <twinBASIC.exe>] [--port N] [--arch win32|win64] [--timeout S] [--llvm] [--exe] [--jobs N] [--keep] [--show|--hide] [--template <name>] [--with-vb6] [--with-images] [--vb6 <VB6.EXE>] [--existing] [--marked] [-h, --help]

Reproducer projects for the entries of BUGS-TO-REPORT.md, under bugs/<slug>/, or
under bugs/filed/<slug>/ once the entry has been filed upstream.
<slug> is kebab-case: lowercase letters and digits joined by single hyphens, and
is never "filed".

A reproducer may also have a VB6 project in vb6/, to show what VB6 does. It holds
sources only (Probe.vbp and its .bas, .cls, .frm and .ctl files, with their
.frx and .ctx), builds Probe.exe, and writes what it finds to out.txt beside the
exe, handling every error itself.

A graphical defect also carries pictures. repro.json's "images" lists their names; the
PngDump modules (PngDump.twin in src/Sources/, PngDump.bas in vb6/) save each as <name>.png
in the folder named by the BUGREPRO_IMAGES environment variable, which run and vb6 set. They
are kept in images/ as <name>-tb.png (run) and <name>-vb6.png (vb6), and when both exist
<name>-compare.png shows twinBASIC, VB6 and their difference: the picture for the issue.

Commands:
  new <slug> "<title>"  create bugs/<slug>/src/ from the console template, with a
                        project of the slug's name and a Startup module, and
                        bugs/<slug>/repro.json with "mode": "manual"; with
                        --template, from that template's Settings and Sources;
                        with --with-vb6, also bugs/<slug>/vb6/, from the VB6
                        template under test/repro-templates/vb6/; with
                        --with-images, also the PngDump modules from
                        test/repro-templates/png/, and "images": ["main"] in repro.json
  pack <slug>           pack src/ into <slug>.twinproj with scripts/impexp.mjs, and
                        write <slug>.zip, the file a GitHub issue accepts, with the
                        files repro.json's "attach" names and the files of images/;
                        when vb6/ exists, also write <slug>-vb6.zip, holding its
                        source files only; print the -compare.png pictures that go
                        into the issue
  compile <slug>        pack, then compile the project in the IDE (tbbuild) and
                        print its diagnostics
  build <slug>          pack, then compile and build it (tbbuild --build)
  run <slug>            run a copy of src/ whose [RunAfterBuild] probe calls Sub
                        Main, and print what it writes to the DEBUG CONSOLE (tbrun);
                        with "images" in repro.json, keep each picture as
                        images/<name>-tb.png
  vb6 <slug>            build vb6/ with VB6 in a copy under the temp folder (never
                        in the repository), run Probe.exe on a private desktop,
                        and print out.txt. A project may have forms. A project
                        that calls MsgBox or InputBox is refused. Needs VB6; no IDE.
                        With "images" in repro.json, keep each picture as
                        images/<name>-vb6.png
  verify [slug ...]     run what each repro.json says, for the named reproducers or
                        all of bugs/* and bugs/filed/*, and report per reproducer
                        whether it reproduces; a filed one is labelled with its
                        issue, and one that no longer reproduces is probably fixed.
                        Needs a twinBASIC install; run by a person only. A run-mode
                        reproducer with expect.imagesDiffer compares its fresh
                        pictures (kept in the temp folder) with images/<name>-vb6.png.
                        A lane reproducer ("lane": "ide:<lane>" or "addin:<lane>")
                        reproduces when every test it names passes; its lanes run
                        last, through ide_test or addin_test. A probe reproducer
                        runs node <script> <args...> and is judged by its expect
  file <slug> <issue>   move the entry whose reproducer is <slug> out of
                        BUGS-TO-REPORT.md into bugs/filed/<slug>/REPORT.md, move
                        bugs/<slug>/ to bugs/filed/<slug>/, and record the issue in
                        its repro.json
  file --marked         do that for every entry that carries a mark line under its
                        title: *FILED #<n>*, *CAPTURED IN EXISTING #<n>* or
