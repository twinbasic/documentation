# twinBASIC bugs to report

A queue, not a record. Each entry is a **product** bug --- something twinBASIC itself does
wrong --- observed while working on this documentation. **Delete an entry once it has been
filed upstream**; nothing here is meant to accumulate, and an entry that stays after it is
filed turns this file into a second, worse issue tracker.

Documentation defects do not belong here. They are fixed in `docs/`, and the ones that are
not yet fixed are recorded in the relevant `WIP.*.md`.

What an entry owes a reader:

- the **build** it was seen on, because the answer changes between betas;
- a **minimal reproduction**, narrowed rather than pasted --- the thing that made it
  reproduce is usually smaller and stranger than the code it was found in;
- what was tried that did **not** reproduce it, which is half of what makes a report
  actionable;
- how it was **observed**, so somebody else can see the same thing.

## Compiler crashes on an `Interface` whose name and base are both angle-bracket placeholders

**Build:** BETA 983 (`twinBASIC_win32.dll+00141F7A`)
**Severity:** crash --- takes the compiler down, three restarts, then the IDE gives up.

This two-line file is the whole reproduction:

```
Interface <name> Extends <base-interface>
End Interface
```

The IDE's DEBUG CONSOLE reports `NATIVE EXCEPTION: ACCESS_VIOLATION {no-basic-code}` with
`>>> thread 0004: ParsingFileStart, <that file>`, then `restarting from MEMORY`, three
times over.

**Neither half reproduces it on its own**, which is what makes it worth reporting rather
than shrugging at:

| source | result |
|---|---|
| `Interface <name>` + `End Interface` | TB5182 Syntax error, no crash |
| `Interface IFoo Extends <base-interface>` + `End Interface` | TB5182 + TB5079 + TB5127, no crash |
| `Interface <name> Extends <base-interface>` + `End Interface` | **crash** |

So it takes a placeholder in *both* positions. The input is not real code --- it is a
syntax skeleton, the shape `docs/Reference/Attributes.md` uses to show where an attribute
goes --- but a parser meeting nonsense should diagnose it, and this one dereferences
something instead.

**Found by** pointing `scripts/check_examples.mjs` at the documentation's own code samples;
the skeleton is one of the 1,116 `tb` fences under `docs/`. A crash in a batch of samples
costs the whole batch its result, which is why that tool bisects on exit code 4.

## `--buildAndExit32` writes nothing, exits 0 on a project with errors, and hangs on a failing build

**Build:** BETA 983
**Severity:** makes the documented unattended-build switch unusable.

The IDE executable accepts `--buildAndExit32` and `--buildAndExit64`; `parseCommandLine()`
reads them, and Personal Edition is refused by name, so they are real. Measured three ways:

- **nothing is written to stdout or stderr, ever** --- no diagnostics, no summary;
- it **exits 0 on a project the IDE flags with errors**;
- when the build genuinely fails it **does not exit at all**, sitting on a *"Please wait…"*
  dialog at 100% indefinitely.

Silent, falsely green, and hanging on the one case worth catching. This is why
`scripts/tbbuild.mjs` drives the IDE's WebView over CDP instead --- see
[WIP.md](WIP.md#compiling-a-twinbasic-project-without-the-ide-in-front-of-you), which
records the same measurements.
