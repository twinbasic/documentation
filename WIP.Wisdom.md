# twinBASIC Documentation --- Wisdom

The Discord knowledge-harvesting tool: a three-phase pipeline (`export` →
`process` → `extract`) that mines the twinBASIC Discord for things the
documentation does not yet say, and drafts additions for human review. Plans in
`wisdom/PLAN-{1,2,3}.md`; implementation under `wisdom/`. Uses only Node.js
built-in APIs.

Split out of [WIP.md](WIP.md) because Wisdom runs occasionally and its
invocation detail has no business in the context of a session doing anything
else. WIP.md keeps only the rule that Wisdom is an exception to; open this file
when actually running the tool.

## Why its public page is allowed to name Claude

WIP.md's rule is that **nothing under `docs/Documentation/` should require
Claude, an agent or a skill to follow** --- the audience is a contributor with
an editor and a terminal.

**[Wisdom](docs/Documentation/Wisdom.md) is a deliberate exception and stays
public.** The tool has no manual mode to document --- Phase 3 *is* a set of
Claude agents, and a page describing it without them would describe nothing. A
reviewer applying the rule will read its "tell Claude: …" instructions as a
scope violation and propose relocating the *public page* to a maintainer file.
That has been considered and declined; leave `docs/Documentation/Wisdom.md`
where it is. (This file is not that relocation: what moved here is WIP.md's own
invocation notes, not the reader-facing page.)

## Phase 3 --- Extract invocation

Phase 3 runs Claude agents over the processed thread `.md` files and drafts documentation additions. The default flow is **incremental**: only threads whose Discord-side content has actually changed since the last successful merge are re-extracted. Combined with the incremental `export` and `process` phases, the routine update is three commands with no flags:

```
node wisdom/wisdom.mjs export
node wisdom/wisdom.mjs process
node wisdom/wisdom.mjs extract
```

The `extract` step itself is a three-stage flow that Claude orchestrates: prep → workflow → merge. The merge step grafts new findings into the long-lived `staging.md`, replacing matching sections in place and emitting `[REFINED?]` markers for findings whose prior version has been reviewed and removed --- so pending review work is never clobbered.

1. **Prep**: `node wisdom/wisdom.mjs extract` filters threads against `wisdom/data/findings/extract-state.json` (the per-thread `last_message_id` + `message_count` watermark, advanced on each successful merge). Only changed threads survive the filter. Shared reference files (`package-summary.txt`, `page-index.json`) are written once; per-batch files contain thread file paths, per-thread file sizes, config, and a `mode` field (`incremental`, `since`, `all`, or `force`) consumed by the merge step.
   - If the filter is empty (no threads have changed), prep exits with `No new threads since the last successful merge` and the merge step is unnecessary.
2. **Run the workflow**: check which prep layout was produced:
   - **Single-batch** (≤200 threads) --- `extract-prep.json` exists: read it, pass its parsed contents as `args` to the Workflow tool with `scriptPath: "wisdom/extract/workflow.mjs"`. Write the returned `{ additions: [...] }` array to `wisdom/data/findings/extract-results-0.json`.
   - **Multi-batch** (>200 threads) --- `extract-manifest.json` exists: read it, then for each entry in `manifest.batches`, read the corresponding `extract-batch-{i}.json`, pass it as `args` to the Workflow tool, and write the returned additions array to `extract-results-{i}.json`. Skip batches whose result file already exists (resumability).
3. **Merge**: `node wisdom/wisdom.mjs extract --merge` reads every `extract-results-*.json`, grafts the additions into `staging.md` per the merge semantics in [wisdom/PLAN-3.md](wisdom/PLAN-3.md#merge-semantics), and advances `extract-state.json`. Atomic write via temp+rename; previous `staging.md` retained as `staging.md.bak` for one generation.
4. **Review**: `wisdom/data/findings/staging.md` is the long-lived human-review file --- grouped by target page, with `[DUPLICATE?]` markers for cross-thread overlaps, `[REFINED?]` markers for previously-processed findings whose source thread has grown, and an `Unmapped Findings` section for findings with no existing doc page. The reviewer can append `[LOCKED]` to any section header to prevent auto-replacement on the next merge.

**Diagnostic modes** (mutually exclusive primary flags):
- `extract --since 2026-06-04` --- filter by thread `created` date instead of watermark. State is not touched; merge writes to `staging-since-2026-06-04.md` rather than grafting into the canonical staging file.
- `extract --all` --- bootstrap / re-baseline. Processes every thread regardless of state and ignores the channel filter. Merge still grafts (replacing matching sections, inserting new ones) so an existing `staging.md` is not lost.
- `extract --force` --- ignores the watermark filter but respects `--channel`. Useful when the agent prompt changes and specific channels need re-extraction.
- `extract --dry-run` --- writes the prep file but does not invoke the workflow; state is not touched.
