# twinBASIC Documentation --- Authoring a Page

The page-writing contract, split out of [WIP.md](WIP.md) so a session that is
not writing documentation does not carry it. **Read this before writing or
editing any page under `docs/`.** WIP.md keeps the placement rules, the
plain-English prose rules and the Don'ts; everything about the shape of a page
is here.

The public, contributor-facing distillation of the same conventions is
[docs/Documentation/Authoring.md](docs/Documentation/Authoring.md). This file
remains the exhaustive maintainer source of truth; keep the two in sync when a
convention changes.

## Page template

Match the existing style. Worked examples to imitate:

- Core statement: `docs/Reference/Core/Const.md`, `docs/Reference/Core/Dim.md`, `docs/Reference/Core/Call.md`.
- VBA module function: `docs/Reference/Default/VBA/Interaction/AppActivate.md`, `docs/Reference/Default/VBA/Interaction/Beep.md`.
- VBA property with `Core/` redirect: `docs/Reference/Default/VBA/DateTime/Date.md`.
- VBRUN module member: `docs/Reference/Default/VBRUN/AmbientProperties/BackColor.md`, `docs/Reference/Default/VBRUN/PropertyBag/index.md`.
- VB control class (folder-style; all current VB classes): `docs/Reference/Default/VB/CheckBox/index.md`, `docs/Reference/Default/VB/CheckMark/index.md`.
- Assert module page (single-file, all members inline): `docs/Reference/Built-In/TwinBasicAssertions/Exact.md`.
- CEF control class (folder-style with a sub-page): `docs/Reference/Built-In/CEF/CefBrowser/index.md` + `docs/Reference/Built-In/CEF/CefBrowser/EnvironmentOptions.md`.
- Generic class (single-file, `(Of T1, T2)`): `docs/Reference/Built-In/WinEventLogLib/EventLog.md`.
- Folder-style control with collection sub-objects: pattern to follow for WinNativeCommonCtls's `ImageList/`, `ListView/`, `TreeView/` — `<Container>/index.md` for the control's own surface plus sibling `<Container>/<SubObject>.md` per collection / item. Mirror CustomControls's `WaynesButton/` + `WaynesButton/WaynesButtonState.md` shape.

Formatting conventions:

- Heading levels: the page title is `#` (a *chapter* -- a page may legitimately have more than one). Top-level sections (Example, See Also, ...) are `##`; subsections `###`. Do **not** skip `##` with the old `# Title` -> `### Example` "house style". That pattern (h1 straight to h3) exists on many older pages only to keep GitHub's raw-markdown view at a modest heading size; it is a heading-order defect on the built site. `headingLevelNormalizePlugin` in [builder/render.mjs](builder/render.mjs) repairs those legacy pages at build time (it raises `h3`->`h2` on any page that uses h1 and h3 but no h2), so existing pages are not being churned all at once -- but new content must use correct levels, and pages that already mix `##` and `###` are left untouched. A mixed page that skips a level is a real defect the normalizer will not save you from: five were found and fixed this way, and axe's `heading-order` rule now guards the sample against more.
- `**...**` for keywords/literal tokens; `*...*` for placeholders/arguments.
- Code blocks use ` ```tb ` (highlighted via Shiki using the vendored `builder/twinbasic.tmLanguage.json` grammar).
- Parameter lists use the deflist `term` + `: definition` indentation pattern (NOT the MS-style markdown table).
- Set `vba_attribution: true` in the frontmatter on any page derived from VBA-Docs; omit it on fully original content (e.g. VB package pages). The flag drives an extra line in the site footer.

### Attribution policy

The attribution rule is **per-page**, determined by content provenance — not by package membership. A symbol existing in VBA is not sufficient to require the flag: the twinBASIC page must have been derived (verbatim or paraphrased) from a specific VBA-Docs source page. Many symbols that exist in VBA have no dedicated VBA-Docs page at all, and even where one exists the twinBASIC page may have been written independently. In particular, `VBA/HiddenModule`, `VBA/Compilation`, `VBA/TbExpressionService`, and twinBASIC-specific additions within VBA modules (`CType`, `If`, `CallByDispId`, `RaiseEventByName`, `ObjPtr`, `VarPtr`, `StrPtr`, ...) are twinBASIC-original and correctly omit `vba_attribution: true` regardless of their package location.

### Authoring-only frontmatter

Three keys on a package's `index.md` are **provenance for the authoring pass**. None of
them reaches the HTML --- `grep -r indexed_from docs/_site` returns nothing, because nothing
in `template.mjs` iterates frontmatter generically; every consumer reads a named field. The
build reads one of them, `exclude_from_docs`, for one purpose: the symbol index's count of
public symbols no page documents leaves those names out (`reportableGaps` in
[builder/symbols.mjs](builder/symbols.mjs), and `--symbol-gaps` writes the list). Leave all
three in place.

| Key | Means |
|-----|-------|
| `indexed_from` | The twinBASIC build whose package download the documentation was indexed against. Currently `beta-x-0983` on all six. |
| `exclude_from_docs` | Modules or classes in that package deliberately left undocumented --- internals, private helpers, API shims. |
| `exclude_kinds` | Member *kinds* deliberately left undocumented. Only `WinEventLogLib` uses it, for `Declare`. |

Together they say what a completeness check should expect: **re-index the package from a
newer build, and anything new that is not named in `exclude_from_docs` or `exclude_kinds` is
a documentation gap.** Without them a re-index cannot tell "not yet written" from
"deliberately omitted", which is the whole point of recording them.

The six packages carrying `indexed_from` are `AppGlobalClassObject`, `CustomControls`,
`TwinBasicAssertions`, `WinEventLogLib`, `WinNamedPipesLib` and `WinServicesLib`, all set by
the 2026-06-04 pass: `9f406eb`, `05ed96b`, `77c6a03`, `4cd4f4b`, `3429b97`, `6a68815`.
`exclude_from_docs` is on three of them (`InternalStuff`; `EventLogHelperPrivate` +
`EventLogAPIs`; `ServicesConstantsPublic`).

**Bump `indexed_from` whenever a package is re-indexed against a newer build**, in the same
commit as the content it adds. A stale value is worse than none: it asserts a completeness
check was run against a build that no longer matches the package.

> **These keys are also in active use by package documentation work that has not landed
> yet**, covering packages beyond the six above. If you are about to document a package
> from scratch, ask first --- it may already be written and waiting to merge.

One other inert key exists, and is a different thing: `has_children` on four pages is a
just-the-docs leftover. tbdocs derives the nav tree itself and never reads it. Harmless, but
it is theme residue rather than something anyone is meant to maintain.

### `symbols:` --- what a page documents, for the symbol index

The build's symbol index (`tB/symbols.json`, [WIP.HelpAddin.md](WIP.HelpAddin.md#stage-3-the-symbol-index-generated-by-the-docs-build))
learns what a page documents from its title, less a trailing `Module`, `class` and the
like, and the comma-separated names of its first heading --- `# Left, LeftB` documents
both. A page whose title cannot name its subject says so with `symbols:`, which replaces
those names. Two pages need it: the (Default) module (`[_HiddenModule]`) and the comparison
operators (`["=", "<>", "<", "<=", ">", ">="]`, quoted, since a bare `>` is YAML). On a
Core statement page the first name is the statement and the rest its keywords; on an
operator page each is an operator.

The build names any page in a package folder that gives the index no entry, after its
summary line. That is the cue for a third. **Do not add `symbols:` to change how a page
ranks or to add a keyword a page merely mentions**: the index is what the page documents,
and a keyword such as `ElseIf` belongs on a page only when the page explains it.

### Cross-section linking

Relative links resolve against the **rendered URL** (the page's `permalink:`), not the file path. Pages that share a URL folder can use bare names (`[Y](Y)`); crossing folders needs `../` to climb out.

The URL prefixes are *not* uniform across packages — VBA pages live one segment shallower than VBRUN pages, so cross-package links are asymmetric:

- Core statement → `/tB/Core/<Symbol>`
- VBA module member → `/tB/Modules/<Mod>/<Symbol>` (legacy scheme retained)
- VBRUN module member → `/tB/Packages/VBRUN/<Mod>/<Symbol>`
- VB class → `/tB/Packages/VB/<Class>`, or `/tB/Packages/VB/<Class>/` for folder-style classes (one extra segment)
- WebView2 class → `/tB/Packages/WebView2/<Class>` (or `/tB/Packages/WebView2/<Class>/` for folder-style — used by `WebView2/`)
- WebView2 enumeration → `/tB/Packages/WebView2/Enumerations/<Enum>` (one segment deeper than a class, parallel to VBRUN's `Constants/<Enum>`)
- Assert module → `/tB/Packages/Assert/<Mod>` (single-page-per-module; same depth as a single-file VB class)
- CustomControls control → `/tB/Packages/CustomControls/<Control>` (single-file) or `/tB/Packages/CustomControls/<Control>/` (folder-style — used by `WaynesButton/`, `WaynesForm/`, `WaynesGrid/`, `WaynesSlider/`, `WaynesTextBox/`)
- CustomControls style helper → `/tB/Packages/CustomControls/Styles/<Name>`
- CustomControls framework symbol → `/tB/Packages/CustomControls/Framework/<Name>`
- CustomControls enumeration → `/tB/Packages/CustomControls/Enumerations/<Enum>`
- CEF `CefBrowser` class → `/tB/Packages/CEF/CefBrowser/` (folder-style — has the `EnvironmentOptions` sub-page)
- CEF `EnvironmentOptions` sub-page → `/tB/Packages/CEF/CefBrowser/EnvironmentOptions`
- CEF enumeration → `/tB/Packages/CEF/Enumerations/<Enum>`
- WinEventLogLib class → `/tB/Packages/WinEventLogLib/EventLog` (single-file; same depth as a single-file VB class)
- WinEventLogLib module → `/tB/Packages/WinEventLogLib/EventLogHelperPublic` (single-file; same depth as an Assert module)
- WinNamedPipesLib class → `/tB/Packages/WinNamedPipesLib/<Class>` (single-file; same depth as a single-file VB class)
- WinServicesLib class / interface → `/tB/Packages/WinServicesLib/<Class>` (single-file; same depth as a single-file VB class)
- WinServicesLib enumeration → `/tB/Packages/WinServicesLib/Enumerations/<Enum>` (one segment deeper, parallel to WebView2 / CEF / CustomControls)
- tbIDE class / CoClass → `/tB/Packages/tbIDE/<Class>` (single-file; same depth as a single-file VB class — no `Enumerations/` sub-folder, the nested enums live on their declaring class's page)
- WinNativeCommonCtls control → `/tB/Packages/WinNativeCommonCtls/<Class>` (single-file — used by `DTPicker`, `MonthView`, `ProgressBar`, `Slider`, `UpDown`) or `/tB/Packages/WinNativeCommonCtls/<Container>/` (folder-style — used by `ImageList/`, `ListView/`, `TreeView/`, each carrying their sub-object companion pages)
- WinNativeCommonCtls sub-object → `/tB/Packages/WinNativeCommonCtls/<Container>/<SubObject>` (e.g. `ImageList/ListImage`, `ListView/ListItem`, `TreeView/Node`)
- WinNativeCommonCtls enumeration → `/tB/Packages/WinNativeCommonCtls/Enumerations/<Enum>` (one segment deeper, parallel to WebView2 / CEF / CustomControls / WinServicesLib)

Always link to the **canonical** location (the page's `permalink:`), not to a `redirect_from` alias. Pages that have moved out of `Core/` retain a `redirect_from: /tB/Core/<X>` so legacy links still work, but forward-style links should point at the new home.

### `Description` attributes are not connected to this documentation

Package `.twin` sources carry `[Description("...")]` attributes whose content is Markdown,
rendered in the IDE's own information popups. They look like documentation and they are not
part of this project: **there is no sync between them and these pages, in either direction,
and the `/tB/` permalinks have nothing to do with them.**

Keeping them in step is deliberate future work, waiting on a proper help IDE plugin. Until
that exists, do not write anything implying the two are connected --- not a "see also", not a
claim that a permalink is referenced from source, not an obligation to update one when the
other changes. A reviewer looking at a `Description` string and at a reference page for the
same symbol will reach for that connection; there isn't one yet.

Related: **`[Documentation(...)]` is not a twinBASIC attribute.** It does not exist. It was
asserted in eight places, including a `tb` code sample teaching it, as the in-source consumer
of the `/tB/` URL contract. The real attribute is `[Description(...)]`, which is not that.
The IDE help system remains a genuine consumer of the permalinks.

## Per-symbol workflow

1. **Decide placement** — pick the package's section convention:
   - Pure language keyword (parsed by the compiler, no runtime call) → `docs/Reference/Core/`.
   - Runtime function/property → `docs/Reference/<Package>/<Mod>/`. Add `redirect_from: /tB/Core/<name>` so legacy `tB/Core/<name>` links still work.
   - VB control class → `docs/Reference/Default/VB/<Class>.md` (single-file) or `docs/Reference/Default/VB/<Class>/index.md` (folder-style).
   - WebView2 → `docs/Reference/Built-In/WebView2/<Class>.md` (single-file) or `<Class>/index.md` (folder-style; the main `WebView2` class uses it). Enums under `WebView2/Enumerations/`; the one public Type under `WebView2/Types/`.
   - Assert module → `docs/Reference/Built-In/TwinBasicAssertions/<Mod>.md` — one page per module with all 15 members inline.
   - CustomControls control → single-file under `docs/Reference/Built-In/CustomControls/<Control>.md`, or folder-style when a state-holder / options sub-page is required. Shared style helpers under `Styles/`, framework symbols under `Framework/`, enums under `Enumerations/`.
   - CEF → `docs/Reference/Built-In/CEF/CefBrowser/index.md` (folder-style with the `EnvironmentOptions` sub-page); enums under `CEF/Enumerations/`.
   - WinEventLogLib / WinNamedPipesLib / WinServicesLib → flat, one page per public class under `docs/Reference/<Pkg>/<Class>.md`. WinServicesLib enums live under `WinServicesLib/Enumerations/`.
   - tbIDE → flat, one page per CoClass / Class under `docs/Reference/Built-In/tbIDE/<Class>.md`; nested enums fold onto their declaring class's page (no `Enumerations/` sub-folder).
   - WinNativeCommonCtls → single-file (`DTPicker`, `MonthView`, `ProgressBar`, `Slider`, `UpDown`) or folder-style (`ImageList/`, `ListView/`, `TreeView/`) when the control has sub-object companions. Module-level enums under `Enumerations/`; per-control nested enums fold onto the declaring control's page.
   - Pick `<Mod>` from VBA's grouping (Information, Interaction, Strings, FileSystem, DateTime, Math, Financial, Conversion, ...) and the existing folders under `Reference/<Package>/`.
2. **Flag tB deviations** with a `> [!NOTE]` callout (see next section).
3. **Update the parent index** — turn an unlinked bullet into a link with a short blurb. Match the existing style of the page. If a new package is being added, also add a bullet to `docs/Reference/Built-In.md` (or `Default.md`) and bump the count on `docs/Reference/Packages.md` and `docs/Reference/index.md`. `Packages.md` itself only links to those two landing pages -- it does not enumerate packages, which is how `AppGlobalClassObject` went unlisted for months.
4. **Add the page** to `Reference/Statements.md` or `Reference/Procedures and Functions.md` if it's a statement or callable and not already listed there.
5. **Run the [site integrity check](WIP.md#site-integrity-check)** after the batch and before committing.

## twinBASIC deviations from VBA to flag

Add a `> [!NOTE]` callout or rewrite the affected section when source diverges. Known cases:

- `Date`, `Date$`, `Time`, `Time$` are **properties** in twinBASIC, not functions/statements — see `docs/Reference/Default/VBA/DateTime/Date.md` for the pattern.
- `Decimal` is a **full data type** in twinBASIC, not just a **Variant** subtype: `Dim x As Decimal` compiles and runs. VBA-Docs text that calls it unsupported, or reachable only through `CDec`, must be rewritten --- see [Features → New Data Types](docs/Features/Language/Data-Types.md).
- twinBASIC adds `Continue`, attribute syntax `[Description("...")]`, and other features documented under `docs/Features/`.
- Some VBA-Docs pages have Office-host-specific Application objects — irrelevant; omit.
- Mac-specific notes from VBA-Docs are typically irrelevant; trim.

When in doubt about a tB-specific behavior, check `docs/Features/` and `docs/Reference/index.md` before assuming VBA semantics carry over.

## Document the product as it is, not as it was

**twinBASIC is in a long beta, so a superseded name is not history --- it is noise.**
Document the current API and nothing else. A reader cannot use a name that no longer
exists, cannot search for it, and has to carry two names in their head to read one snippet.

Two CustomControls tutorials showed `Public Sub New(Serializer As SerializationInfo)` and
`Deserialize()`, each with a NOTE underneath explaining that the framework actually names
them `SerializeInfo` and `RuntimeUISrzDeserialize()`. Both pages now show the current names
and carry no note; the snippets are shorter and the reader has one name per thing.

Version-skew notes earn their place when a reader may be *on* the older version --- a
behaviour that changed in a shipped BETA, where the page says which build changed it (see
`redirect_from` and the `[!NOTE]` conventions above). Nobody is on a pre-release draft of a
name. **From v1 this rule relaxes**: once there are releases people stay on, what changed
between them becomes something a reader needs.

## A script is findable only if its bare name is a token prefix somewhere

lunr's tokeniser splits on **whitespace and hyphens only** (`/[\s\-]+/`), and the site's
query adds a *trailing* wildcard. Put those together and a heading written
`### scripts/check_page_baseline.mjs` indexes as one token beginning `scripts/`, which a
reader's query `check_page_baseline` can never prefix-match. Measured:

| query | results |
|---|---|
| `scripts/check_page_baseline.mjs` | 4 |
| `check_page_baseline` | **0** |
| `check-page-baseline` | 420, as noise --- hyphens split, so it becomes three common words |

`build_dot_metrics` was 0 as well. An evaluator issued seven queries including the gate's
own filename and verbatim prose from its section, and never once saw it --- **the string a
refused developer actually has in hand is the one that found nothing.**

**The fix was to drop the directory prefix from the headings**, so the token becomes
`check_page_baseline.mjs` and the trailing wildcard reaches it. Nothing is lost from the
page: each entry's anchor is pinned with `{: #... }` so no URL moved, and the synopsis
block on the next line still shows the full `node scripts/<name>.mjs`. Every script name
returns hits now, and the index grew by nothing.

**Two other fixes were measured and rejected, and both are worth not re-proposing.**
Raising `search.heading_level` to 3 --- so each `###` becomes its own entry, which is what
would give a script section its own title boost and its own anchor in the results ---
**doubles the index, 3,742 entries to 7,524, and does not fix it**: the titles still carry
the `scripts/` prefix, so the bare query still misses. That is a 3.4 MB payload every page
already downloads, doubled, for nothing. Widening the tokeniser's separator to include
`/`, `_` and `.` is the other obvious proposal; the `check-page-baseline` row above is
what it would do to *every* path token on a site whose subject matter is `Debug.Print`
and `_App`.
