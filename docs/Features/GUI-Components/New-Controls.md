# New Controls

twinBASIC introduces several new controls to enhance your applications.

## QR Code Control

Easily display custom QR codes with a native control.

## Multiframe Control

This control allows you to create a number of frames within it with their size specified as a percentage, such that as the control is resized the frames within expand proportionally. For details and a video demonstration, Mike Wolfe's twinBASIC Weekly Update [covered it when released](https://nolongerset.com/twinbasic-update-april-29-2025/#experimental-multi-frame-control).

Combined with anchors and docking, this allows designing highly functional and complex layouts visually, without writing any code to handling resizing.

## CheckMark Control

Primarily intended for reports but available in Forms and UserControls as well, the CheckMark control provides a scalable check component where this is fixed to a single size in a normal CheckBox control.
