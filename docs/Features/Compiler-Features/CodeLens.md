# Run Subs from the IDE

The CodeLens feature allows running Subs and Functions, with no arguments and in modules (but not classes/Forms/UserControls) right from the editor without starting the full program. It has robust access to your code; it can access constants, call other functions both instrinsic and user-define, call APIs, and print to the Debug Console.

Methods eligible to run with CodeLens (when enabled), have a bar above them that you can click to run:
