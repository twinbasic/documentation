# CommandButton

![CommandButton](Images/CommandButton.png "CommandButton")

This object corresponds to a command button. A command button on a form can start an action or a set of actions. For example, you could create a command button that opens another form. To make a command button do something, you write an event procedure and attach it to the button's `Click` property.
